# Provost-Fellow

I was awarded a Provost Fellowship during the summer of 2019. 
I presented the poster at the STARS Computing Corps Conference
I won 3rd place for my poster (the .pdf and .jpg attached in this repository)

A side project continuation that was worked on with 2 other undergraduate students can be found here

The work and methods I used to work through the datasets is all seen throughout work,
meant to remove clutter on main page.

More updates based on requirements will be added
