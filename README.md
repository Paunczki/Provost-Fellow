# Provost-Fellow

I was awarded a Provost Fellowship during the summer of 2019. 
I presented the poster at the STARS Computing Corps Conference
I won 3rd place for my poster (the .pdf and .jpg attached in this repository)

A side project continuation that was worked on with 2 other undergraduate students can be found here
